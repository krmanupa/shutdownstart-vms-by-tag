Shutdown/Start VMs by tag
=========================

            

This script shutdowns/starts VMs by a given tag and its value.




If you don't have it, you have to create a Credential Asset with the name **DefaultAzureCredential** in order to access your account. 
You can know more about this script here: [https://www.returngis.net/2016/07/por-que-etiquetar-tus-recursos-en-microsoft-azure/](https://www.returngis.net/2016/07/por-que-etiquetar-tus-recursos-en-microsoft-azure/)
Any comment would be appreciated :)
